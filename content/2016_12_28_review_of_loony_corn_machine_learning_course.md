Summary: My review of "From 0 to 1: Machine Learning, NLP and Python - Cut to the Chase" on Udemy.

[TOC]

## Course

I decided to squeeze one more course in before 2016 ended. This time I chose 
["From 0 to 1: Machine Learning, NLP and Python - Cut to the Chase"][1] by the LoonyCorn team on Udemy. This course was
a 20 hour overview of machine learning techniques. I've been interested in taking some more formal training on various
machine learning algorithms and this course sounded like it would be useful. 


## Thoughts on the lessons 

I was very disappointed in this course. The lessons had large portions of time that overlapped one another, the 
background music was distracting, the "coding" portions weren't done in a way that facilitated me to follow along, 
the instructor's speaking volume isn't consistent and code was presented with bugs and the instructor glossed over 
them with a simple "we'll fix those later". The theories were presented fairly well, but really should have been 
condensed. 
 
It took me a few lessons to realize it, but the course notes - effectively power point slides that are hand written 
during the lecture - and the instructor's voice were recorded at different times. This is most obvious when the *exact*
same portion, either the notes, the vocal explanation or both, is used again in later lessons. This is done repeatedly
in the course. This resulted in sections of the same lecture that had periods where the instructor's voice was very loud
and others where they were very quiet. 

My biggest disappointment, though, was with the coding exercises. I was hoping for some hands on activities. Instead,
the instructor spoke while the code with all comments was coded "live". The code was done quickly and offered no time 
for me to actually code and listen. The explanation of the code was very specific to what was being done and wasn't
made generic enough to be applicable to many other activities. Worst of all, the coding and explanation were clearly 
recorded separately, because buggy code was presented and glossed over. 

## Final Thoughts

This course wasn't worth my time. The theory portions were *just* good enough that I stuck with it hoping to pick out
something useful, but it never seemed to materialize. I did complete the course and don't feel I've learned anything
that I can apply elsewhere. In the new year, I'll be looking for another machine learning course that, hopefully, is
much better than this one.
