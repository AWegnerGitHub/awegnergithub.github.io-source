  - Only the hexes - not the navigation/forward/backward aspect
- https://www.danflyingsolo.com/ - First impresssion is good - but not a huge fan of the scroll down
- https://elliotjaystocks.com/ - Top text is a little large; Blog section is nice looking; About (timeline) is really nice
- https://html5up.net/
    - https://html5up.net/stellar - If it doesn't have to be single page
    - https://html5up.net/editorial - Sidenav, not top (eh...)
    - https://html5up.net/hyperspace - Need to figure out how to do blogs with that layout, nice highlight on left nav
    - https://html5up.net/read-only - Interesting right nav + highlight on scroll (maybe for articles?)
    - https://html5up.net/prologue - Left nav + highlight on scroll 
    - https://html5up.net/striped - Looks like a basic blog - left nav, nice calendar on entries
    - https://html5up.net/txt - Top nav with active page 
    - https://html5up.net/halcyonic - Nice blog look. Column #2 layout looks great for Blog, Metadata, Review/Series information. 3 and 1 column layouts also look useful. LIKE THIS ONE BEST...NEEDS SPICING UP THOUGH 
    - https://html5up.net/minimaxing - Similar to above 
    

Navbars I like:

- Side 
  - https://codepen.io/adefful46/pen/eYOWReR - Large side, 3d perspective (can get annoying), sensitive to mouseover 
  - https://www.cssscript.com/demo/smooth-collapsible-sidebar-navigation/ - Collapsable
  - https://css-tricks.com/a-dynamically-sized-sticky-sidebar-with-html-and-css/ - Combined with jump link to stick on side
- Top 
  - https://codepen.io/pec-man/pen/bGbeXqZ - Sticky, Subnav, but subnav is ABOVE regular nav
  - https://codemyui.com/stretch-and-expand-underline-on-click-navigation/ - Indicator of where you are, nice subtle stretch (would work across pages or require one big page?)
  - https://codemyui.com/elastic-gradient-navigation-tab/ - Same concerns as above, less subtle too
  - https://codemyui.com/simple-sticky-navigation-menu/ - Sticky Top
  - https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-a-shrinking-header-on-scroll-without-javascript/ - Collapseable top 
- Jump links
  - https://codemyui.com/jump-link-sidebar-navigation-for-articles/ - Clean, subcategories
  - https://codemyui.com/sticky-sidebar-navigation-on-scroll/ - Basic
- Stick Header 
  - https://dev.to/akhilarjun/one-line-sticky-header-using-css-5gp3
  



Themes 
 - Hexagons? 
   - Hexnav at top that collapses to standard sticky header; Or to side nav 
   - About Author is a hexagon instead of circle 
   - Hoverover could be hexes
